<h3 style="background-color:DodgerBlue;">Basic Doggo Facts</h3>
<p style=color:DodgerBlue;">Doggos are very mysterious creatures.  They are a little silly and crazy.  They like to eat food as well as steal human food for extra snacks.  In their spare time, doggos like to play ball, fetch, or just run around.  Some doggos are more laid back than other doggos, so they like to sleep or rest somewhere cozy.  That is the end of doggo facts.  Enjoy your future doggo encounters!</p>
