In this world, the woman from eHarmony that wants to hug every cat is in a world of cats.  She has put cat hats and cat ears on the dogs in the world because she wants everything to be a cat, but the dogs are upset by this.

The woman in this made an eHarmony bio video introducing herself and said how much she loves cats.  She started crying and saying how much she wants to hug every cat, but she can't.  I used that meaning behind the meme to create a world of cats where she is really happy because all the things around her are cats.  She has taken a step further by forcing the dogs to wear cat ears too because she wants them to be cats too.
