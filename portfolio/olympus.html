<p style="text-align:center;font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;color:black;font-size:20px;">The series is paintings of Greek deities that have been glitched including Hermes, Aphrodite, and finally Zeus (including the images of Hermes and Aphrodite).  I wanted to turn older works of art into something using glitch to contrast the old versus the new, as well as to break the perfect, romanticized image of the Greek gods.  The final image includes both techniques, and I combined all of the .raws together in audacity before exporting it to photoshop and messing around on there for the final image.  There are many pieces of other paintings and messages included in the data as well that are invisible.
