A 3D print of my minecraft sculpture.  I printed him out and painted him with acrylic paints to match Basil's actual colors a bit better than I could in Minecraft.  He is about two inches tall, while the first draft print was about an inch tall and was too difficult to cut away from his scaffolding.  I ended up breaking off his feet by accident, so the second and final print was a bit bigger.
